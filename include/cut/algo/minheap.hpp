/**
 * @brief       This class represents a min-heap data structure.
 * 
 * @details     The class cut::MinHeap provides an interface for a min-heap
 *              data structure.\n 
 *              The cut::MinHeap contains integer elements mapped to double
 *              precision floating point keys.\n 
 *              While this structure seems very specific, it can be used for
 *              basically everything, since key updates can be deferred outside
 *              of this class, and integer values can be used to map array
 *              positions.\n 
 *              This class can also be used to realize max-heap structures
 *              (see constructor's documentation). 
 * 
 * @warning     This interface does not support deletions or insertions,
 *              but only increasing and decreasing of keys.\n 
 *              This limitation is intentional, as it allows for an efficient
 *              implementation.
